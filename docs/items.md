camera for to have visual information of what is happening if needed.

we can use connect to screen if needed.

### what i need? (software)

- python
- python-telegram-bot
- selenium
- google account
- google chrome
- telegram 
- bash (not is nessary)
- anydesk (not is nessary)
- crontab (not is nessary)

### why

**python**
script is made in python

**telegram** and **python-telegram-bot**
is is for a remote interface

**google chrome** for **selenium** 
we need selenium to do web scarping to automatic access to the meet that we send to the raspberry pi , we do not have access to initiate a remote meeting

**google account**
because we going to use google meets

**bash**
automate installation and generate some reconfigurations 

**anydesk**
for remote configurations beacuse we have dificults for use ssh for internet provider reasons

**crontab**
schedule reconfigurations
